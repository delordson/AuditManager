<h2>Audit Manager</h2>
The Audit Manager App is targeted at businesses who need to maintain standards for regulatory and compliance purposes. That’s all of us right? The Audit Manage App allows organisation to schedule a series of audits of their facilities, procedures and processes, to assign auditors, to capture audit findings and to track corrective and preventative actions arising from those audit findings.

<h2>Modules</h2>
The Audit Manager App Modules includes a Home Page, the Manage Audits Module,  the Manage Auditors Module, the All Audit Findings Module, the My Audit Findings Module, the My Finding Actions Module and the Settings Module.

&nbsp;
<h2>Access</h2>
Access is controlled through a log in screen. The administrator uses an associated Silverlight application to configure new users, create roles and permissions for those roles as well as to assign users to roles.

&nbsp;
<h2>The Home Screen</h2>
Access to all the features of the Audit Manager App is from the home page. From here, users can navigate to the ‘Manage Audits Module’, the ‘Manage Auditors Module’, the ‘All Audit Findings Module’, the ‘My Audit Findings Module’, the ‘My Finding Actions Module’ and the ‘Settings Module’.

&nbsp;
<h2>Manage Audits</h2>
Clicking or tabbing on the Manage Audits button takes the user to the ‘Browse Audits’ Page. On this page, the user of presented with a list of all audits past and future. A search box is present for quickly navigating to a required audit.

<a href="https://github.com/delordson/AuditManager/blob/master/Resources/screenshot_11052013_064819.png"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-1543" title="screenshot_11052013_064819" alt="" src="https://github.com/delordson/AuditManager/blob/master/Resources/screenshot_11052013_064819-1024x575.png" width="700" height="393" /></a>

&nbsp;

Clicking or tabbing on any audit listed takes the user to a page for managing that audit. This page provides for full details of the audit, including a scheduled date, a date started and a date completed.

The page is laid out in a series of tabs. The first tab presents key information about the audit such as its reference code, a description, state and end dates and a status.

<a href="https://github.com/delordson/AuditManager/blob/master/Resources/screenshot_11052013_065241.png"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-1544" title="screenshot_11052013_065241" alt="" src="https://github.com/delordson/AuditManager/blob/master/Resources/screenshot_11052013_065241-1024x575.png" width="700" height="393" /></a>

&nbsp;

Of course the built in LightSwitch validation of required fields and field lengths works great as expected…

<a href="https://github.com/delordson/AuditManager/blob/master/Resources/screenshot_11052013_065303.png"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-1546" title="screenshot_11052013_065303" alt="" src="https://github.com/delordson/AuditManager/blob/master/Resources/screenshot_11052013_065303-1024x575.png" width="700" height="393" /></a>

&nbsp;

…but we’ve also added multi field validation where it makes sense. So you can’t complete an audit before it has started.

<a href="https://github.com/delordson/AuditManager/blob/master/Resources/screenshot_11052013_065251.png"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-1545" title="screenshot_11052013_065251" alt="" src="https://github.com/delordson/AuditManager/blob/master/Resources/screenshot_11052013_065251-1024x575.png" width="700" height="393" /></a>

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

The Auditors tab is where auditors are assigned. Any of your employees can be assigned as the auditors for a given audit.

<a href="https://github.com/delordson/AuditManager/blob/master/Resources/screenshot_11052013_065312.png"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-1547" title="screenshot_11052013_065312" alt="" src="https://github.com/delordson/AuditManager/blob/master/Resources/screenshot_11052013_065312-1024x575.png" width="700" height="393" /></a>

&nbsp;

<a href="https://github.com/delordson/AuditManager/blob/master/Resources/screenshot_11052013_065318.png"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-1548" title="screenshot_11052013_065318" alt="" src="https://github.com/delordson/AuditManager/blob/master/Resources/screenshot_11052013_065318-1024x575.png" width="700" height="393" /></a>

&nbsp;

The Audit Findings Tab is where any audit non compliances and audit failings are recorded.

<a href="https://github.com/delordson/AuditManager/blob/master/Resources/screenshot_11052013_065323.png"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-1549" title="screenshot_11052013_065323" alt="" src="https://github.com/delordson/AuditManager/blob/master/Resources/screenshot_11052013_065323-1024x575.png" width="700" height="393" /></a>

&nbsp;

Clicking or tabbing on an audit finding takes the user to the audit findings management page.

<a href="https://github.com/delordson/AuditManager/blob/master/Resources/screenshot_11052013_065330.png"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-1550" title="screenshot_11052013_065330" alt="" src="https://github.com/delordson/AuditManager/blob/master/Resources/screenshot_11052013_065330-1024x575.png" width="700" height="393" /></a>

&nbsp;

The page is laid out in a series of tabs. The details tab provides key information about the audit finding, including a reference number, a description of the finding, a person the finding is assigned to for investigation and resolution as well as target dates. As soon as an audit finding is assigned to a member of staff they get an automatic email informing them they have been so assigned.

&nbsp;

<a href="https://github.com/delordson/AuditManager/blob/master/Resources/AuditFindingAssignedEmail.png"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1539" title="AuditFindingAssignedEmail" alt="" src="https://github.com/delordson/AuditManager/blob/master/Resources/AuditFindingAssignedEmail.png" width="848" height="497" /></a>

&nbsp;

The Impact tab allows the auditors to record the impact this audit finding potentially has on the business.

<a href="https://github.com/delordson/AuditManager/blob/master/Resources/screenshot_11052013_065335.png"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-1551" title="screenshot_11052013_065335" alt="" src="https://github.com/delordson/AuditManager/blob/master/Resources/screenshot_11052013_065335-1024x575.png" width="700" height="393" /></a>

&nbsp;

The Immediate Action tab provides a place for the person the Finding is assigned to indicate those first urgent initial and immediate steps they are going to take to resolve the issue. This is not necessarily the full resolution but a quick way of reducing risk. The full corrective and preventative actions are added to the CAPA tab.

<a href="https://github.com/delordson/AuditManager/blob/master/Resources/screenshot_11052013_065338.png"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-1552" title="screenshot_11052013_065338" alt="" src="https://github.com/delordson/AuditManager/blob/master/Resources/screenshot_11052013_065338-1024x575.png" width="700" height="393" /></a>

&nbsp;

The Further Actions tab is where additional steps which need to be take to resolve the issue are listed. These Further Actions can be assigned to other Employees.

<a href="https://github.com/delordson/AuditManager/blob/master/Resources/screenshot_11052013_065347.png"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-1554" title="screenshot_11052013_065347" alt="" src="https://github.com/delordson/AuditManager/blob/master/Resources/screenshot_11052013_065347-1024x575.png" width="700" height="393" /></a>

<a href="https://github.com/delordson/AuditManager/blob/master/Resources/screenshot_11052013_065342.png"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-1553" title="screenshot_11052013_065342" alt="" src="https://github.com/delordson/AuditManager/blob/master/Resources/screenshot_11052013_065342-1024x575.png" width="700" height="393" /></a>

&nbsp;

Again Employees get an email as soon as a Further Action is assigned to them.

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

The CAPA tab is where the full Corrective Action and Preventative Action (CAPA) is recorded. CAPA’s have a target date by which they need to be completed.

<a href="https://github.com/delordson/AuditManager/blob/master/Resources/screenshot_11052013_065514.png"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-1555" title="screenshot_11052013_065514" alt="" src="https://github.com/delordson/AuditManager/blob/master/Resources/screenshot_11052013_065514-1024x575.png" width="700" height="393" /></a>

&nbsp;

Finally there is a Notes tab for capturing any additional information such as lessons learnt for example.

<a href="https://github.com/delordson/AuditManager/blob/master/Resources/screenshot_11052013_065518.png"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-1556" title="screenshot_11052013_065518" alt="" src="https://github.com/delordson/AuditManager/blob/master/Resources/screenshot_11052013_065518-1024x575.png" width="700" height="393" /></a>
